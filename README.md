• Implementation of symmetrical & skewed CMOS inverter 

    ◦ Implemented a CMOS inverter & observed voltage transfer characteristics for evaluating noise margins using LTspice
    ◦ Simulated designed CMOS inverter for different sizes & observed effect of sizing on rise & fall time delays using LTspice
